## Molecular Family Explored

Cluster: 2498  
Node 2390: Bromocriptine  
Parent mass: 654.228  
Library hit: Yes  

Node 2357: Unknown  
Parent mass: 636.218  
Library hit: No  

Connection: Strong cosine similarity and edge between nodes

## Neutral Loss Analysis

A mass difference of approximately 18.01 Da was observed between node 2390 and node 2357

This neutral loss corresponds to dehydration (H₂O loss), a common MS/MS fragmentation event
