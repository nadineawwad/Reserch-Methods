## Embryo Fixation Protocol

#### *Day 1*

perform the fertilization

#### *Day 2*

<ol>
 <li>Have embryo culture at your desired time points for e.g. 20hpf.</li>
 <li>Observe the culture, to check that the culture healthy and at right time point </li>
<li> Take pictures
</li>
 <li>Now pour the culture into a falcon tube and centrifuge it 2000rpm at 4C for 2 minutes. We use the big centrifuge from Mickyâ€™s lab. </li>
 <li>After that, carefully suck out the ASW out of the tube by a suction leaving 1ml of solution.</li>
 <li>Transfer the 1ml pellet0 containing embryos to 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.</li>  
<li>Spin down the culture by centrifuging for 1 min. Suck the supernatant.</li>
<li> Now add the 1ml of 50% of the fixative and placed the tube inside the 4C fridge in a designated rack, for 1hour.</li> 
<li> After 1hour remove the fixative by suction, add 1ml of 100% fixative, and keep the tube in 4C for at least 24h (24h-27h). Do remember to keep on turning the tube ensuring the fixative reach embryo.</li>


</ol>

### *Day 3* 

1. Next day, after 25h remove the fixative by suction and added 1ml of MABT buffer for 15 minutes and then remove. 
2. Repeat the step 10 5 more times.
